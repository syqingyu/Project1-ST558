## Vignettes
Vignettes are explanations of some concept, package, etc. with text, code, and output interweaved. We
already know how to make them with R Markdown!

## Project Objectives
This project involves creating a vignette (HTML with table of contents) about reading in data and exploring
it. The JSON group will create a vignette about reading JSON data into R with an example that includes basic
exploratory data analysis (summaries and graphs - more details on this later). The XML group will do the
same with an XML data set.

## Vignette Content Details
The components of vignette include:

* Describe the type of data (JSON or XML). What is it, where does it get used, and why is it a good way to store data? This should be detailed enough that someone that hasn’t seen that type of idea would have a good idea what they are dealing with. You should link to references where applicable.
* Discussion of possible packages/functions that are available for reading the type of data into R. Choose one and explain why we’ve chosen it.
* Find a dataset of the type (JSON or XML) and describe where we found the data, how the data was collected, what the variables are, etc.  
    - The data we read in have at least two categorical variables and two quantitative variables.
* Read in the data set describing the options package’s functions allow.
* Perform basic exploratory data analysis that reveals a meaningful idea that we would reasonable want to investigate further. Not all things reported need to show something meaningful (i.e. graphs that show no relationship are fine) but we end up with a solid lead that you would pursue further.  
    - We create a useful function(s) to do something meaningful with the data or customize the way you read the data in.  
    - Create a new variable.  
    - Create some contingency tables and numeric summaries by some of your categorical
variables.  
    - Create some plots (at least a side-by-side bar plot, side-by-side box plots, and scatter
plots with coloring)
