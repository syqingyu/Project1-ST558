# General Description of JSON File

JSON [Java Script Object Notation] and XML [eXtensible Markup Language] are both popular choices to exchange data between 2 systems over the interenet or in general. JSON is becoming more and more popular these days as it's compact, lightweight and easy to use. JSON uses a map data structure rather than XML's tree. In some situations, key/value pairs can limit what you can do, but you get a predictable and easy-to-understand data model.

# Description of the Data Set Chosen

There are several JSON data sets are available from federal/state/county/city or other sources. We have selected the <a href = "https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/Accidental-Drug-Related-Deaths-2012-2018/rybz-nyjw" > accidental drug related deaths from 2012-2018 dataset </a> from state of Connecticut. A "Y" value under the different substance columns indicates that particular substance was detected. Data are derived from an investigation by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner which includes the toxicity report, death certificate, as well as a scene investigation. <br>
The dataset contains 5,105 rows and 42 columns and each row is a Death. The data captures Date of the incident, Sex, Race, Age, Location Data, Resposible Drug, Cause of Death, Opiod or Not etc.

# Reading JSON File

### Download and Examine the JSON file

After we have downloaded the JSON file from the above mentioned link we have examined it in the firefox (**Maybe you could explain what the firefox is). The JSON has a metadata portion along with the data segment.

```{r JSON PIC1, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./files/JSON1.jpg")
```
```{r JSON PIC2, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./files/JSON2.jpg")

# These images are a little hard to understand
```
<br><br>
We have used the `jsonlite` package to read in the JSON file. 

```{r readJSON1, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
library(jsonlite)
library(tidyverse)
library(gdata)
library(ggplot2)

myJSON <- fromJSON("./files/DrugOverdose.json")
class(myJSON)
```
Let's examine the structure and attibutes a bit further.

```{r readJSON2, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
attributes(myJSON)
attributes(myJSON[['meta']])
attributes(myJSON[['meta']][['view']])
```
### Extract the column names.

From the webpage we have observed the JSON has 41 rows. By inspecting the column names metadata we can discard the first 9 columns and select the rest.

```{r readJSON3, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
colNames <-myJSON[['meta']][['view']][['columns']]
colNames<- colNames[c(9:50),2]
colNames
```

### Extract the Data Portion

Let's examine the data segment of the JSON file in the JSON editor/browser.

```{r JSON PIC3, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./files/JSON3.jpg")
```
<br><br>
We can see the data portion of the JSON file is a nested list and let's make sure the length of the top list matches the no of rows we have from the source page.

```{r readJSON4, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
myData <- myJSON[['data']]
length(myData)
```
### Generate Data Frame from JSON

This custom function reads the list data and convert that to a data frame and tibble. The DeathCityGeo, ResidenceCityGeo and InjuryCityGeo are nested list. The function reads the lattitude and longtitude from those nested lists.

```{r readJSON5, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
collectData<-function(var){
  sapply(myData, function(x) returnData(x, var)) 
}

returnData<-function(x, var){
  if(length(x[[var]]) > 1){
    return(trim(paste(x[[var]][[2]], x[[var]][[3]], sep = ",")))
  }
  else{
    if(!is.null( x[[var]])){
    return( trim(x[[var]]))
  }else{
    return(NA)
  }
  }
}

drugDF<-data.frame(sapply(9:50, collectData), stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

drugOverDoseTD <- tbl_df(drugDF)
colnames(drugOverDoseTD) <- colNames
drugOverDoseTD
```
Convert the Age and Town Index to numeric and the date column to date type.

```{r convertJSON1, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
drugOverDoseTD['Age'] <- as.numeric(drugOverDoseTD$Age)
drugOverDoseTD['Town Index'] <- as.numeric(drugOverDoseTD$`Town Index`)
drugOverDoseTD['Date'] <- as.Date(drugOverDoseTD$Date)
```

# Create New Variables

We have the Date and DateType column which has  DateReported/DateofDeath. We can extract the Year from the date which can help us to summarize data by year if needed. Also we have another quantative column Age; and we can use that to create a categorical variable which may be usuful to analyze the affected ages.

```{r createVar1, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
library(lubridate)

#Create the Year Variable
drugOverDoseTD['Year'] <- year(drugOverDoseTD$Date)

#Create Age Category Variable 
drugOverDoseTD<- drugOverDoseTD %>% mutate(Age_Category = ifelse(Age < 18, 'Minor', ifelse(Age > 18 & Age <= 25, 'Age 18 to 25', ifelse(Age > 25 & Age <= 35, 'Age 26 to 35', ifelse(Age > 35 & Age <= 45, 'Age 36 to 45', ifelse(Age > 46 & Age <= 55, 'Age 46 to 55', ifelse(Age > 55 & Age <= 65, 'Age 56 to 65', 'More than 65')))))))

#Verify the results
head(drugOverDoseTD[, 43:44], n=10)
```

# Data Analysis

### Summarise data

Below table shows the summary of the reported ages. We can see the affected ages in a range as low as 14 and as high as 87 and the mean & median both are at around 42.

```{r summData1, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
library(knitr)
library(DT)

#Age Summary
datatable(enframe(round(summary(drugOverDoseTD$Age, na.rm = TRUE),2)), options = list(dom ="t"), caption = "Age Summary", rownames = FALSE)
```
Below table summarises the age category frequency summary from year 2012 to 2018 in 7 different levels. We can see there are 13 incidents involving Minors. Majority of the affected population are between age 26 to age 55.

```{r summData2, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
#Age Category Frequency
datatable(enframe(table(factor(drugOverDoseTD$Age_Category, levels = c("Minor",  "Age 18 to 25", "Age 26 to 35", "Age 36 to 45", "Age 46 to 55", "Age 56 to 65", "More than 65")))), options = list(dom ="t"), caption = "Age Category Frequency", rownames = FALSE)
```
Let's break down the the age catory frequency by each year now from 2012 to 2018. Though we don't see any significan't change in the number of incidents involving minors but rest of the age categories show a steady rise in the number of accidents involving drug overdose.

```{r summData3, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
#Year Vs Age Category Frequency
datatable(as.data.frame.matrix(table(drugOverDoseTD$Year, factor(drugOverDoseTD$Age_Category, levels = c("Minor",  "Age 18 to 25", "Age 26 to 35", "Age 36 to 45", "Age 46 to 55", "Age 56 to 65", "More than 65")))), options = list(dom ="t"), caption = "Year Vs Age category Frequency")

#create the Sex Vs Age category table
sexAgeTable <- table(drugOverDoseTD$Sex, factor(drugOverDoseTD$Age_Category, levels = c("Minor",  "Age 18 to 25", "Age 26 to 35", "Age 36 to 45", "Age 46 to 55", "Age 56 to 65", "More than 65")))

#Print the table
datatable(as.data.frame.matrix(sexAgeTable), options = list(dom ="t"), caption = "Sex Vs Age Category table")

datatable(drugOverDoseTD %>% group_by(Race, Sex) %>% summarise(Count = n(), Mean_Age = round(mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE), 2)) %>% drop_na() %>% arrange(Mean_Age), options = list(dom ="t"), caption = "Race - Sex - Age Summary", rownames = FALSE)
```

### Visualise data

May want to add more text above graphs to understand what is being shown and why. ALso, the last graph has two categories but only one line.

```{r visData1, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)

#Plot Incident Count for each Year
g<- ggplot(data = drugOverDoseTD , aes(x = Year))
g+geom_bar(color = "blue", fill="light blue") + labs(title = "No. of Incidents Every Year")

#Plot Different Drug Vs Overdose Count
drugCount <- apply(X= select(drugOverDoseTD, Heroin:OpiateNOS), MARGIN = 2, FUN = function(y) { 
     temp <- length(y[!is.na(y)])
      names(temp) <- "Overdose Counts"
      temp
       })
drugCount<- tibble::enframe(drugCount)
names(drugCount) <- c("Drug", "No. Of Incidents")

p<-ggplot(data=drugCount, aes(x=Drug, y= `No. Of Incidents`)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", color = "black", fill = "grey") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)) + coord_flip() + labs(title = "No. of Incidents by Each Drug")
  
p

```
```{r visData2, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}

#Plot Different Drug Vs Overdose Count for each Year
#Take Year and the different drugs
drugYearCount<- drugOverDoseTD[, c(43, 21:36)]
#Make it a long Tidy Data Set
drugYearCount<- drugYearCount %>% gather(key = Drug, value = 'Y/N', 2:17)
#Remove NAs
drugYearCount<- drugYearCount[complete.cases(drugYearCount) , ]
#make tibble
drugYearCount <- tbl_df(as.data.frame(drugYearCount %>% group_by(Year, Drug) %>% summarise(Count = n())))

#Verify the data
datatable(drugYearCount, options = list(dom ="t"), caption = "Year and Drug", rownames = FALSE)

g<- ggplot(data = drugYearCount, aes(x = Year, y = Count))
g + geom_line(aes(color = Drug, alpha = 0.5), lwd =1.5) + labs(title = "No. of Incidents by Each Drug from 2012-2018 ")

```
```{r visData3, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
#Plot Year with Age and Sex
g<- ggplot(data = drugOverDoseTD, aes(x = Age, fill = Sex))
g + geom_bar()

# Year and Sex Line plot
drugYearSexCount <- as.data.frame(drugOverDoseTD %>% group_by(Year, Sex) %>% summarise(Count = n()))
drugYearSexCount<- drugYearSexCount[complete.cases(drugYearSexCount) & trim(drugYearSexCount$Sex) != 'Unknown', ]

g<- ggplot(data = drugYearSexCount, aes(x = Year, y = Count))
g + geom_line(aes(color = Sex), lwd =1.5)
```

```{r visData4, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
drugOpioid <- drugOverDoseTD %>% group_by(Year, AnyOpioid) %>% summarise(OpioidRelatedDeath = n()) %>% drop_na()

g<- ggplot(data = drugOpioid, aes(x = Year, y = OpioidRelatedDeath))
g + geom_line(aes(color = AnyOpioid), lwd =1.5) + labs(title = "Opioid Related Death from 2015-2018 ")
```

# Reading JSON File

### Download and Examine the JSON file

After we have downloaded the JSON file from the above mentioned link we have examined it in the firefox. The JSON has a metadata portion along with the data segment.

```{r JSON PIC1, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./files/JSON1.jpg")
```
```{r JSON PIC2, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./files/JSON2.jpg")
```
<br><br>

We have used the `jsonlite` package to read in the JSON file. The `jsonlite` package allows us to work with and manipulate json files. We are able to read in a json file by using the `fromJSON` function in this package. This will read in the JSON file as a list and we will examine the structure and convert it to a data frame for easy manipulation and analysis. The useage for a `fromJSON` file is as follows:

fromJSON(txt, simplifyVector = TRUE,
  simplifyDataFrame = simplifyVector, simplifyMatrix = simplifyVector,
  flatten = FALSE, ...)

For our purposes, we will only use the first argument of the fromJSON function, 'txt'. 'txt' will represent the JSON file that we are reading in and analyzing. As you can see in the following code chunk, we were able to read in our JSON file using this command. 

```{r readJSON1, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
library(jsonlite)
library(tidyverse)
library(gdata)
library(ggplot2)

#reads in JSON file 
myJSON <- fromJSON("./files/DrugOverdose.json")
#displays the type of object after the JSON file is read in
class(myJSON)
```
Let's examine the structure and attibutes a bit further.

```{r readJSON2, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
attributes(myJSON)
attributes(myJSON[['meta']])
attributes(myJSON[['meta']][['view']])
```
### Extract the column names.

From the webpage we have observed the JSON has 41 rows. By inspecting the column names metadata we can discard the first 9 columns and select the rest.

```{r readJSON3, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
colNames <-myJSON[['meta']][['view']][['columns']]
colNames<- colNames[c(9:50),2]
colNames
```

### Extract the Data Portion

Let's examine the data segment of the JSON file in the JSON editor/browser.

```{r JSON PIC3, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./files/JSON3.jpg")
```
<br><br>
We can see the data portion of the JSON file is a nested list and let's make sure the length of the top list matches the no of rows we have from the source page.

}

returnData<-function(x, var){
  if(length(x[[var]]) > 1){
    return(trim(paste(x[[var]][[2]], x[[var]][[3]], sep = ",")))
  }
  else{
    if(!is.null( x[[var]])){
    return( trim(x[[var]]))
  }else{
    return(NA)
  }
  }
}

drugDF<-data.frame(sapply(9:50, collectData), stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

drugOverDoseTD <- tbl_df(drugDF)
colnames(drugOverDoseTD) <- colNames
drugOverDoseTD
```
Convert the Age and Town Index to numeric and the date column to date type.

```{r convertJSON1, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
drugOverDoseTD['Age'] <- as.numeric(drugOverDoseTD$Age)

#Verify the results
head(drugOverDoseTD[, 43:44], n=10)
```

# Data Analysis

### Summarise data

#### Age Summary

Below table shows the summary of the reported ages. We can see the affected ages in a range as low as 14 and as high as 87 and the mean & median both are at around 42.

```{r summData1, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
library(knitr)
library(DT)

#Age Summary
datatable(enframe(round(summary(drugOverDoseTD$Age, na.rm = TRUE),2)), options = list(dom ="t"), caption = "Age Summary", rownames = FALSE)
```

#### Age Category Summary

Below table summarises the age category frequency summary from year 2012 to 2018 in 7 different levels. We can see there are 13 incidents involving Minors. Majority of the affected population are between age 26 to age 55.

```{r summData2, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
#Age Category Frequency
datatable(enframe(table(factor(drugOverDoseTD$Age_Category, levels = c("Minor",  "Age 18 to 25", "Age 26 to 35", "Age 36 to 45", "Age 46 to 55", "Age 56 to 65", "More than 65")))), options = list(dom ="t"), caption = "Age Category Frequency", rownames = FALSE)
```

Let's break down the the age catory frequency by each year now from 2012 to 2018. Though we don't see any significan't change in the no of incidents involving minors but rest of the age categories show a steady rise in the no of accidents involving drug overdose. We found that for females, the highest number of incidents was in the age group 46-55. For males it was in the age group 26-35. So it appears that younger males and middle aged females account for more opiod death related incidents.

```{r summData3, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
#Year Vs Age Category Frequency
datatable(as.data.frame.matrix(table(drugOverDoseTD$Year, factor(drugOverDoseTD$Age_Category, levels = c("Minor",  "Age 18 to 25", "Age 26 to 35", "Age 36 to 45", "Age 46 to 55", "Age 56 to 65", "More than 65")))), options = list(dom ="t"), caption = "Year Vs Age category Frequency")

#create the Sex Vs Age category table
sexAgeTable <- table(drugOverDoseTD$Sex, factor(drugOverDoseTD$Age_Category, levels = c("Minor",  "Age 18 to 25", "Age 26 to 35", "Age 36 to 45", "Age 46 to 55", "Age 56 to 65", "More than 65")))

#Print the table
datatable(as.data.frame.matrix(sexAgeTable), options = list(dom ="t"), caption = "Sex Vs Age Category table")

datatable(drugOverDoseTD %>% group_by(Race, Sex) %>% summarise(Count = n(), Mean_Age = round(mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE), 2)) %>% drop_na() %>% arrange(Mean_Age), options = list(dom ="t"), caption = "Race - Sex - Age Summary", rownames = FALSE)
```

#### Average Age Summary

In the next summary, we can see tha average age based on sex and race. We found that the average age for men was 42 and for women was 43. The interesting thing was that for unknown gender, the average age was 66. For the average age by race, we found that the Chinese had the lowest average age of 24 and Hawaiians had the highest average age of 58. 

```{r summdata4, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
#average age by gender
avgAgeSex<-drugOverDoseTD %>% group_by(Sex) %>% summarise(round(mean(Age),0))
colnames(avgAgeSex)[colnames(avgAgeSex) == "round(mean(Age), 0)"] <- "Average Age"
kable(avgAgeSex)

#average age by race

avgAgeRace<-drugOverDoseTD %>% group_by(Race) %>% summarise(round(mean(Age),0))
colnames(avgAgeRace)[colnames(avgAgeRace) == "round(mean(Age), 0)"] <- "Average Age"
kable(avgAgeRace)

```

#### Counts by Race & Sex

Below we have two tables that show the count by year and sex. For females, the year 2018 has the highest number of incidents and for males, the year 2017 has the highest number of incidents. 

```{r summary5, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}

raceage<-table(drugOverDoseTD$Race, drugOverDoseTD$Age_Category)
kable(raceage)

sexyear<-table(drugOverDoseTD$Sex, drugOverDoseTD$Year)
kable(sexyear)
```

### Visualise data

#### Drug Counts 

Below includes two bar graphs and a table that descibe the relationships between the type of drug, the number of incidents with that drug, and the years from 2012-2018. From the first bar graph, we can see that the 2017 had the largest number of incidents. In the second bar graph and the data table we observe Heroin has the highest number of incidents at 2529 incidents. 

```{r visData1, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)

#Plot Incident Count for each Year
g<- ggplot(data = drugOverDoseTD , aes(x = Year))
g+geom_bar(color = "blue", fill="light blue") + labs(title = "No. of Incidents Every Year")

#Plot Different Drug Vs Overdose Count
drugCount <- apply(X= select(drugOverDoseTD, Heroin:OpiateNOS), MARGIN = 2, FUN = function(y) { 
     temp <- length(y[!is.na(y)])
      names(temp) <- "Overdose Counts"
      temp
       })
drugCount<- tibble::enframe(drugCount)
names(drugCount) <- c("Drug", "No. Of Incidents")

p<-ggplot(data=drugCount, aes(x=Drug, y= `No. Of Incidents`)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", color = "black", fill = "grey") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)) + coord_flip() + labs(title = "No. of Incidents by Each Drug")
  
p

```

#### Drug Counts by Year

From this output we can see the change from 2012-2018 of each drug and its number of incidents. We see that Fentanyl had a large increase from 2015 to 2018. It also appears that hydrocodone started to decline in the latter years. 


```{r visData2, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}

#Plot Different Drug Vs Overdose Count for each Year
#Take Year and the different drugs
drugYearCount<- drugOverDoseTD[, c(43, 21:36)]
#Make it a long Tidy Data Set
drugYearCount<- drugYearCount %>% gather(key = Drug, value = 'Y/N', 2:17)
#Remove NAs
drugYearCount<- drugYearCount[complete.cases(drugYearCount) , ]
#make tibble
drugYearCount <- tbl_df(as.data.frame(drugYearCount %>% group_by(Year, Drug) %>% summarise(Count = n())))

#Verify the data
datatable(drugYearCount, options = list(dom ="t"), caption = "Year and Drug", rownames = FALSE)

g<- ggplot(data = drugYearCount, aes(x = Year, y = Count))
g + geom_line(aes(color = Drug, alpha = 0.5), lwd =1.5) + labs(title = "No. of Incidents by Each Drug from 2012-2018 ")

```

#### Drug Counts by Sex

From this data, in the bar plot we can see that the number of male incidents is substantially higher than the number of female incidents. In the line graph, we can see a large increase in the number of male incidents and a smaller increase in the number of female incidents.

```{r visData3, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
#Plot Year with Age and Sex
g<- ggplot(data = drugOverDoseTD, aes(x = Age, fill = Sex))
g + geom_bar()

# Year and Sex Line plot
drugYearSexCount <- as.data.frame(drugOverDoseTD %>% group_by(Year, Sex) %>% summarise(Count = n()))
drugYearSexCount<- drugYearSexCount[complete.cases(drugYearSexCount) & trim(drugYearSexCount$Sex) != 'Unknown', ]

g<- ggplot(data = drugYearSexCount, aes(x = Year, y = Count))
g + geom_line(aes(color = Sex), lwd =1.5)
```

#### Change in Opiod Related Deaths

Our last graph demonstrates that there has been a climb in the number of opiod related deaths from 2015 to 2018. 

```{r visData4, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
drugOpioid <- drugOverDoseTD %>% group_by(Year, AnyOpioid) %>% summarise(OpioidRelatedDeath = n()) %>% drop_na()

g<- ggplot(data = drugOpioid, aes(x = Year, y = OpioidRelatedDeath))

# General Description of JSON File

JSON [Java Script Object Notation] and XML [eXtensible Markup Language] are both popular choices to exchange data between 2 systems over the interenet or in general. JSOON is becoming more and more popular these days as it's compact, lightweight and easy to use. JSON uses a map data structure rather than XML's tree. In some situations, key/value pairs can limit what you can do, but you get a predictable and easy-to-understand data model.

# Description of the Data Set Chosen

There are several JSON data sets are available from federal/state/county/city or other sources. We have selected the <a href = "https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/Accidental-Drug-Related-Deaths-2012-2018/rybz-nyjw" > accidental drug related deaths from 2012-2018 dataset </a> from state of Connecticut. A "Y" value under the different substance columns indicates that particular substance was detected. Data are derived from an investigation by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner which includes the toxicity report, death certificate, as well as a scene investigation. <br>
The dataset contains 5105 rows and 42 columns and each row is a Death. The data captures Date of the incident, Sex, Race, Age, Location Data, Resposible Drug, Cause of Death, Opiod or Not etc.

# Reading JSON File

### Download and Examine the JSON file

After we have downloaded the JSON file from the above mentioned link we have examined it in the firefox. The JSON has a metadata portion along with the data segment.

```{r JSON PIC1, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./files/JSON1.jpg")
```
```{r JSON PIC2, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./files/JSON2.jpg")
```
<br><br>

We have used the `jsonlite` package to read in the JSON file. The `jsonlite` package allows us to work with and manipulate json files. We are able to read in a json file by using the `fromJSON` function in this package. This will read in the JSON file as a list and we will examine the structure and convert it to a data frame for easy manipulation and analysis. The useage for a `fromJSON` file is as follows:

fromJSON(txt, simplifyVector = TRUE,
  simplifyDataFrame = simplifyVector, simplifyMatrix = simplifyVector,
  flatten = FALSE, ...)

For our purposes, we will only use the first argument of the fromJSON function, 'txt'. 'txt' will represent the JSON file that we are reading in and analyzing. As you can see in the following code chunk, we were able to read in our JSON file using this command. 

```{r readJSON1, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
library(jsonlite)
library(tidyverse)
library(gdata)
library(ggplot2)

#reads in JSON file 
myJSON <- fromJSON("./files/DrugOverdose.json")
#displays the type of object after the JSON file is read in
class(myJSON)
```
Let's examine the structure and attibutes a bit further.

```{r readJSON2, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
attributes(myJSON)
attributes(myJSON[['meta']])
attributes(myJSON[['meta']][['view']])
```
### Extract the column names.

From the webpage we have observed the JSON has 41 rows. By inspecting the column names metadata we can discard the first 9 columns and select the rest.

```{r readJSON3, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
colNames <-myJSON[['meta']][['view']][['columns']]
colNames<- colNames[c(9:50),2]
colNames
```

### Extract the Data Portion

Let's examine the data segment of the JSON file in the JSON editor/browser.

```{r JSON PIC3, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./files/JSON3.jpg")
```
<br><br>
We can see the data portion of the JSON file is a nested list and let's make sure the length of the top list matches the no of rows we have from the source page.

```{r readJSON4, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
myData <- myJSON[['data']]
length(myData)
```
### Generate Data Frame from JSON

This custom function reads the list data and convert that to a data frame and tibble. The DeathCityGeo, ResidenceCityGeo and InjuryCityGeo are nested list. The function reads the lattitude and longtitude from those nested lists.

```{r readJSON5, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
collectData<-function(var){
  sapply(myData, function(x) returnData(x, var)) 
}

returnData<-function(x, var){
  if(length(x[[var]]) > 1){
    return(trim(paste(x[[var]][[2]], x[[var]][[3]], sep = ",")))
  }
  else{
    if(!is.null( x[[var]])){
    return( trim(x[[var]]))
  }else{
    return(NA)
  }
  }
}

drugDF<-data.frame(sapply(9:50, collectData), stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

drugOverDoseTD <- tbl_df(drugDF)
colnames(drugOverDoseTD) <- colNames
drugOverDoseTD
```
Convert the Age and Town Index to numeric and the date column to date type.

```{r convertJSON1, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
drugOverDoseTD['Age'] <- as.numeric(drugOverDoseTD$Age)
drugOverDoseTD['Town Index'] <- as.numeric(drugOverDoseTD$`Town Index`)
drugOverDoseTD['Date'] <- as.Date(drugOverDoseTD$Date)
```

# Create New Variables

We have the Date and DateType column which has  DateReported/DateofDeath. We can extract the Year from the date which can help us to summarize data by year if needed. Also we have another quantative column Age; and we can use that to create a categorical variable which may be usuful to analyze the affected ages.

```{r createVar1, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
library(lubridate)

#Create the Year Variable
drugOverDoseTD['Year'] <- year(drugOverDoseTD$Date)

#Create Age Category Variable 
drugOverDoseTD<- drugOverDoseTD %>% mutate(Age_Category = ifelse(Age < 18, 'Minor', ifelse(Age > 18 & Age <= 25, 'Age 18 to 25', ifelse(Age > 25 & Age <= 35, 'Age 26 to 35', ifelse(Age > 35 & Age <= 45, 'Age 36 to 45', ifelse(Age > 46 & Age <= 55, 'Age 46 to 55', ifelse(Age > 55 & Age <= 65, 'Age 56 to 65', 'More than 65')))))))

#Verify the results
head(drugOverDoseTD[, 43:44], n=10)
```

# Data Analysis

### Summarise data

#### Age Summary

Below table shows the summary of the reported ages. We can see the affected ages in a range as low as 14 and as high as 87 and the mean & median both are at around 42.

```{r summData1, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
library(knitr)
library(DT)

#Age Summary
datatable(enframe(round(summary(drugOverDoseTD$Age, na.rm = TRUE),2)), options = list(dom ="t"), caption = "Age Summary", rownames = FALSE)
```

#### Age Category Summary

Below table summarises the age category frequency summary from year 2012 to 2018 in 7 different levels. We can see there are 13 incidents involving Minors. Majority of the affected population are between age 26 to age 55.

```{r summData2, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
#Age Category Frequency
datatable(enframe(table(factor(drugOverDoseTD$Age_Category, levels = c("Minor",  "Age 18 to 25", "Age 26 to 35", "Age 36 to 45", "Age 46 to 55", "Age 56 to 65", "More than 65")))), options = list(dom ="t"), caption = "Age Category Frequency", rownames = FALSE)
```

Let's break down the the age catory frequency by each year now from 2012 to 2018. Though we don't see any significan't change in the no of incidents involving minors but rest of the age categories show a steady rise in the no of accidents involving drug overdose. We found that for females, the highest number of incidents was in the age group 46-55. For males it was in the age group 26-35. So it appears that younger males and middle aged females account for more opiod death related incidents.

```{r summData3, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
#Year Vs Age Category Frequency
datatable(as.data.frame.matrix(table(drugOverDoseTD$Year, factor(drugOverDoseTD$Age_Category, levels = c("Minor",  "Age 18 to 25", "Age 26 to 35", "Age 36 to 45", "Age 46 to 55", "Age 56 to 65", "More than 65")))), options = list(dom ="t"), caption = "Year Vs Age category Frequency")

#create the Sex Vs Age category table
sexAgeTable <- table(drugOverDoseTD$Sex, factor(drugOverDoseTD$Age_Category, levels = c("Minor",  "Age 18 to 25", "Age 26 to 35", "Age 36 to 45", "Age 46 to 55", "Age 56 to 65", "More than 65")))

#Print the table
datatable(as.data.frame.matrix(sexAgeTable), options = list(dom ="t"), caption = "Sex Vs Age Category table")

datatable(drugOverDoseTD %>% group_by(Race, Sex) %>% summarise(Count = n(), Mean_Age = round(mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE), 2)) %>% drop_na() %>% arrange(Mean_Age), options = list(dom ="t"), caption = "Race - Sex - Age Summary", rownames = FALSE)
```

#### Average Age Summary

In the next summary, we can see tha average age based on sex and race. We found that the average age for men was 42 and for women was 43. The interesting thing was that for unknown gender, the average age was 66. For the average age by race, we found that the Chinese had the lowest average age of 24 and Hawaiians had the highest average age of 58. 

```{r summdata4, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
#average age by gender
avgAgeSex<-drugOverDoseTD %>% group_by(Sex) %>% summarise(round(mean(Age),0))
colnames(avgAgeSex)[colnames(avgAgeSex) == "round(mean(Age), 0)"] <- "Average Age"
kable(avgAgeSex)

#average age by race

avgAgeRace<-drugOverDoseTD %>% group_by(Race) %>% summarise(round(mean(Age),0))
colnames(avgAgeRace)[colnames(avgAgeRace) == "round(mean(Age), 0)"] <- "Average Age"
kable(avgAgeRace)

```

#### Counts by Race & Sex

Below we have two tables that show the count by year and sex. For females, the year 2018 has the highest number of incidents and for males, the year 2017 has the highest number of incidents. 

```{r summary5, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}

raceage<-table(drugOverDoseTD$Race, drugOverDoseTD$Age_Category)
kable(raceage)

sexyear<-table(drugOverDoseTD$Sex, drugOverDoseTD$Year)
kable(sexyear)
```

### Visualise data

#### Drug Counts 

Below includes two bar graphs and a table that descibe the relationships between the type of drug, the number of incidents with that drug, and the years from 2012-2018. From the first bar graph, we can see that the 2017 had the largest number of incidents. In the second bar graph and the data table we observe Heroin has the highest number of incidents at 2529 incidents. 

```{r visData1, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)

#Plot Incident Count for each Year
g<- ggplot(data = drugOverDoseTD , aes(x = Year))
g+geom_bar(color = "blue", fill="light blue") + labs(title = "No. of Incidents Every Year")

#Plot Different Drug Vs Overdose Count
drugCount <- apply(X= select(drugOverDoseTD, Heroin:OpiateNOS), MARGIN = 2, FUN = function(y) { 
     temp <- length(y[!is.na(y)])
      names(temp) <- "Overdose Counts"
      temp
       })
drugCount<- tibble::enframe(drugCount)
names(drugCount) <- c("Drug", "No. Of Incidents")

p<-ggplot(data=drugCount, aes(x=Drug, y= `No. Of Incidents`)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", color = "black", fill = "grey") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)) + coord_flip() + labs(title = "No. of Incidents by Each Drug")
  
p

```

#### Drug Counts by Year

From this output we can see the change from 2012-2018 of each drug and its number of incidents. We see that Fentanyl had a large increase from 2015 to 2018. It also appears that hydrocodone started to decline in the latter years. 


```{r visData2, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}

#Plot Different Drug Vs Overdose Count for each Year
#Take Year and the different drugs
drugYearCount<- drugOverDoseTD[, c(43, 21:36)]
#Make it a long Tidy Data Set
drugYearCount<- drugYearCount %>% gather(key = Drug, value = 'Y/N', 2:17)
#Remove NAs
drugYearCount<- drugYearCount[complete.cases(drugYearCount) , ]
#make tibble
drugYearCount <- tbl_df(as.data.frame(drugYearCount %>% group_by(Year, Drug) %>% summarise(Count = n())))

#Verify the data
datatable(drugYearCount, options = list(dom ="t"), caption = "Year and Drug", rownames = FALSE)

g<- ggplot(data = drugYearCount, aes(x = Year, y = Count))
g + geom_line(aes(color = Drug, alpha = 0.5), lwd =1.5) + labs(title = "No. of Incidents by Each Drug from 2012-2018 ")

```

#### Drug Counts by Sex

From this data, in the bar plot we can see that the number of male incidents is substantially higher than the number of female incidents. In the line graph, we can see a large increase in the number of male incidents and a smaller increase in the number of female incidents.

```{r visData3, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
#Plot Year with Age and Sex
g<- ggplot(data = drugOverDoseTD, aes(x = Age, fill = Sex))
g + geom_bar()

# Year and Sex Line plot
drugYearSexCount <- as.data.frame(drugOverDoseTD %>% group_by(Year, Sex) %>% summarise(Count = n()))
drugYearSexCount<- drugYearSexCount[complete.cases(drugYearSexCount) & trim(drugYearSexCount$Sex) != 'Unknown', ]

g<- ggplot(data = drugYearSexCount, aes(x = Year, y = Count))
g + geom_line(aes(color = Sex), lwd =1.5)
```

#### Change in Opiod Related Deaths

Our last graph demonstrates that there has been a climb in the number of opiod related deaths from 2015 to 2018. 

```{r visData4, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
drugOpioid <- drugOverDoseTD %>% group_by(Year, AnyOpioid) %>% summarise(OpioidRelatedDeath = n()) %>% drop_na()

g<- ggplot(data = drugOpioid, aes(x = Year, y = OpioidRelatedDeath))
g + geom_line(aes(color = AnyOpioid), lwd =1.5) + labs(title = "Opioid Related Death from 2015-2018 ")
```
