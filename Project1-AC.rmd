# General Description of JSON File

JSON [Java Script Object Notation] and XML [eXtensible Markup Language] are both popular choices to exchange data between 2 systems over the interenet or in general. JSON is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language. JSON is becoming more and more popular these days as it's compact, lightweight and easy to use and easy for humans to read and write. JSON uses a map data structure rather than XML's tree. In some situations, key/value pairs can limit what you can do, but you get a predictable and easy-to-understand data model.<br>

JSON is built on two structures:

* A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array  
* An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence  

<br> These are universal data structures. Virtually all modern programming languages support them in one form or another. It makes sense that a data format that is interchangeable with programming languages also be based on these structures.<br>

In JSON, they take on these forms:

An object is an unordered set of name/value pairs. An object begins with `{`left brace and ends with `}` right brace. Each name is followed by :colon and the name/value pairs are separated by ,comma.<br>

```{r JSON DESC1, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./files/JSON_DESC1.gif")
```
<br> An array is an ordered collection of values. An array begins with [left bracket and ends with ]right bracket. Values are separated by ,comma.

```{r JSON DESC2, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./files/JSON_DESC2.gif")
```
<br>A value can be a string in double quotes, or a number, or true or false or null, or an object or an array. These structures can be nested.

```{r JSON DESC3, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./files/JSON_DESC3.gif")
```
<br> A string is a sequence of zero or more Unicode characters, wrapped in double quotes, using backslash escapes. A character is represented as a single character string. A string is very much like a C or Java string.

```{r JSON DESC4, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./files/JSON_DESC4.gif")
```
<br>A number is very much like a C or Java number, except that the octal and hexadecimal formats are not used.

```{r JSON DESC5, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./files/JSON_DESC5.gif")
```

# Description of the Data Set Chosen

There are several JSON data sets are available from federal/state/county/city or other sources. We have selected the <a href = "https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/Accidental-Drug-Related-Deaths-2012-2018/rybz-nyjw" > accidental drug related deaths from 2012-2018 dataset </a> from state of Connecticut. A "Y" value under the different substance columns indicates that particular substance was detected. Data are derived from an investigation by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner which includes the toxicity report, death certificate, as well as a scene investigation. <br>
The dataset contains 5105 rows and 42 columns and each row is a Death. The data captures Date of the incident, Sex, Race, Age, Location Data, Resposible Drug, Cause of Death, Opiod or Not etc.

# Packages for Reading JSON Data

We have used jsonlite package to read JSON data. The package offers ï¬‚exible, robust, high performance tools for working with JSON in R and is particularly powerful for building pipelines and interacting with a web API. It reads JSON data and converts it to a R data type usually List or Data Frame which can be used for data manipulation and further computation. This is ideal for interacting with web APIs, or to build pipelines where data structures seamlessly flow in and out of R using JSON. The most useful functions are ` fromJSON() ` and `toJSON()`.


# Reading JSON File

### Download and Examine the JSON file

After we have downloaded the JSON file from the above mentioned link we have examined it in the firefox. The JSON has a metadata portion along with the data segment.

```{r JSON PIC1, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./files/JSON1.jpg")
```
```{r JSON PIC2, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./files/JSON2.jpg")
```
<br><br>

We have used the `jsonlite` package to read in the JSON file. The `jsonlite` package allows us to work with and manipulate json files. We are able to read in a json file by using the `fromJSON` function in this package. This will read in the JSON file as a list and we will examine the structure and convert it to a data frame for easy manipulation and analysis. The useage for a `fromJSON` file is as follows:

fromJSON(txt, simplifyVector = TRUE,
  simplifyDataFrame = simplifyVector, simplifyMatrix = simplifyVector,
  flatten = FALSE, ...)

For our purposes, we will only use the first argument of the fromJSON function, 'txt'. 'txt' will represent the JSON file that we are reading in and analyzing. As you can see in the following code chunk, we were able to read in our JSON file using this command. 

```{r readJSON1, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
library(jsonlite)
library(tidyverse)
library(gdata)
library(ggplot2)

#reads in JSON file 
myJSON <- fromJSON("./files/DrugOverdose.json")
#displays the type of object after the JSON file is read in
class(myJSON)
```
Let's examine the structure and attibutes a bit further.

```{r readJSON2, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
attributes(myJSON)
attributes(myJSON[['meta']])
attributes(myJSON[['meta']][['view']])
```
### Extract the column names.

From the webpage we have observed the JSON has 41 rows. By inspecting the column names metadata we can discard the first 9 columns and select the rest.

```{r readJSON3, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
colNames <-myJSON[['meta']][['view']][['columns']]
colNames<- colNames[c(9:50),2]
colNames
```

### Extract the Data Portion

Let's examine the data segment of the JSON file in the JSON editor/browser.

```{r JSON PIC3, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./files/JSON3.jpg")
```
<br><br>
We can see the data portion of the JSON file is a nested list and let's make sure the length of the top list matches the no of rows we have from the source page.

```{r readJSON4, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
myData <- myJSON[['data']]
length(myData)
```
### Generate Data Frame from JSON

This custom function reads the list data and convert that to a data frame and tibble. The DeathCityGeo, ResidenceCityGeo and InjuryCityGeo are nested list. The function reads the lattitude and longtitude from those nested lists.

```{r readJSON5, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
#Custom function to extract data
collectData<-function(var){
  sapply(myData, function(x) returnData(x, var)) 
}

returnData<-function(x, var){
  if(length(x[[var]]) > 1){
    return(trim(paste(x[[var]][[2]], x[[var]][[3]], sep = ",")))
  }
  else{
    if(!is.null( x[[var]])){
    return( trim(x[[var]]))
  }else{
    return(NA)
  }
  }
}

drugDF<-data.frame(sapply(9:50, collectData), stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

drugOverDoseTD <- tbl_df(drugDF)
colnames(drugOverDoseTD) <- colNames
drugOverDoseTD

```
Convert the Age and Town Index to numeric and the date column to date type.

```{r convertJSON1, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
drugOverDoseTD['Age'] <- as.numeric(drugOverDoseTD$Age)
drugOverDoseTD['Town Index'] <- as.numeric(drugOverDoseTD$`Town Index`)
drugOverDoseTD['Date'] <- as.Date(drugOverDoseTD$Date)
```

# Create New Variables

We have the Date and DateType column which has  DateReported/DateofDeath. We can extract the Year from the date which can help us to summarize data by year if needed. Also we have another quantative column Age; and we can use that to create a categorical variable which may be usuful to analyze the affected ages.

```{r createVar1, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
library(lubridate)

#Create the Year Variable
drugOverDoseTD['Year'] <- year(drugOverDoseTD$Date)

#Create Age Category Variable 
drugOverDoseTD<- drugOverDoseTD %>% mutate(Age_Category = ifelse(Age < 18, 'Minor', ifelse(Age > 18 & Age <= 25, 'Age 18 to 25', ifelse(Age > 25 & Age <= 35, 'Age 26 to 35', ifelse(Age > 35 & Age <= 45, 'Age 36 to 45', ifelse(Age > 46 & Age <= 55, 'Age 46 to 55', ifelse(Age > 55 & Age <= 65, 'Age 56 to 65', 'More than 65')))))))

#Verify the results
head(drugOverDoseTD[, 43:44], n=10)
```

# Data Analysis

### Summarise data

#### Age Summary

Below table shows the summary of the reported ages. We can see the affected ages in a range as low as 14 and as high as 87 and the mean & median both are at around 42.

```{r summData1, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
library(knitr)
library(DT)

#Age Summary
datatable(enframe(round(summary(drugOverDoseTD$Age, na.rm = TRUE),2)), options = list(dom ="t"), caption = "Age Summary", rownames = FALSE)
```

#### Age Category Summary

Below table summarises the age category frequency summary from year 2012 to 2018 in 7 different levels. We can see there are 13 incidents involving Minors. Majority of the affected population are between age 26 to age 55.

```{r summData2, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
#Age Category Frequency
datatable(enframe(table(factor(drugOverDoseTD$Age_Category, levels = c("Minor",  "Age 18 to 25", "Age 26 to 35", "Age 36 to 45", "Age 46 to 55", "Age 56 to 65", "More than 65")))), options = list(dom ="t"), caption = "Age Category Frequency", rownames = FALSE)
```

Let's break down the the age catory frequency by each year now from 2012 to 2018. Though we don't see any significan't change in the no of incidents involving minors but rest of the age categories show a steady rise in the no of accidents involving drug overdose. We found that for females, the highest number of incidents was in the age group 46-55. For males it was in the age group 26-35. So it appears that younger males and middle aged females account for more opiod death related incidents.

```{r summData3, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
#Year Vs Age Category Frequency
datatable(as.data.frame.matrix(table(drugOverDoseTD$Year, factor(drugOverDoseTD$Age_Category, levels = c("Minor",  "Age 18 to 25", "Age 26 to 35", "Age 36 to 45", "Age 46 to 55", "Age 56 to 65", "More than 65")))), options = list(dom ="t"), caption = "Year Vs Age category Frequency")
```
Below table summarises Sex Vs Age category table. It shows no of accidents for each age category in each sex combining all year data from 2012 to 2018. We see for female  the age category 46 to 55 has the highest count whereas man as the highest for 26 to 35.

```{r summData4, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
#create the Sex Vs Age category table
sexAgeTable <- table(drugOverDoseTD$Sex, factor(drugOverDoseTD$Age_Category, levels = c("Minor",  "Age 18 to 25", "Age 26 to 35", "Age 36 to 45", "Age 46 to 55", "Age 56 to 65", "More than 65")))

#Print the table
datatable(as.data.frame.matrix(sexAgeTable), options = list(dom ="t"), caption = "Sex Vs Age Category table")
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
```
This is a 3 way table between Race, Sex and Age variables. It displays count and mean age for each Race and Sex.

```{r summData5, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
>>>>>>> 3d1dd3985d4bc8ee495b4e04e385baa0c2a4ac87

datatable(drugOverDoseTD %>% group_by(Race, Sex) %>% summarise(Count = n(), Mean_Age = round(mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE), 2)) %>% drop_na() %>% arrange(Mean_Age), options = list(dom ="t"), caption = "Race - Sex - Age Summary", rownames = FALSE)

```

#### Average Age Summary

In the next summary, we can see tha average age based on sex and race. We found that the average age for men was 42 and for women was 43. The interesting thing was that for unknown gender, the average age was 66. For the average age by race, we found that the Chinese had the lowest average age of 24 and Hawaiians had the highest average age of 58. 

```{r summdata4, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
#average age by gender
avgAgeSex<-drugOverDoseTD %>% group_by(Sex) %>% summarise(round(mean(Age),0))
colnames(avgAgeSex)[colnames(avgAgeSex) == "round(mean(Age), 0)"] <- "Average Age"
kable(avgAgeSex)

#average age by race

avgAgeRace<-drugOverDoseTD %>% group_by(Race) %>% summarise(round(mean(Age),0))
colnames(avgAgeRace)[colnames(avgAgeRace) == "round(mean(Age), 0)"] <- "Average Age"
kable(avgAgeRace)

```

#### Counts by Race & Sex

Below we have two tables that show the count by year and sex. For females, the year 2018 has the highest number of incidents and for males, the year 2017 has the highest number of incidents. 

```{r summary5, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}

raceage<-table(drugOverDoseTD$Race, drugOverDoseTD$Age_Category)
kable(raceage)

sexyear<-table(drugOverDoseTD$Sex, drugOverDoseTD$Year)
kable(sexyear)
```

### Visualise data

<<<<<<< HEAD
#### Drug Counts 

Below includes two bar graphs and a table that descibe the relationships between the type of drug, the number of incidents with that drug, and the years from 2012-2018. From the first bar graph, we can see that the 2017 had the largest number of incidents. In the second bar graph and the data table we observe Heroin has the highest number of incidents at 2529 incidents. 
=======
Let's start visualising no of accidents per year from 2012 to 2018. We see a clear incresing trend from 2012 to 2017 and a slight decrease in 2018.
>>>>>>> 3d1dd3985d4bc8ee495b4e04e385baa0c2a4ac87

```{r visData1, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)

#Plot Incident Count for each Year
g<- ggplot(data = drugOverDoseTD , aes(x = Year))
g+geom_bar(color = "blue", fill="light blue") + labs(title = "No. of Incidents Every Year")

```

This bar plot display the no of accidents for each drug combining all years. It is clear Heroin is most responsible followed by Fentanyl for Accidental Drug Related Deaths from 2012 to 2018.

```{r visData2, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}

#Plot Different Drug Vs Overdose Count
drugCount <- apply(X= select(drugOverDoseTD, Heroin:OpiateNOS), MARGIN = 2, FUN = function(y) { 
     temp <- length(y[!is.na(y)])
      names(temp) <- "Overdose Counts"
      temp
       })
drugCount<- tibble::enframe(drugCount)
names(drugCount) <- c("Drug", "No. Of Incidents")

p<-ggplot(data=drugCount, aes(x=Drug, y= `No. Of Incidents`)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", color = "black", fill = "grey") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)) + coord_flip() + labs(title = "No. of Incidents by Each Drug")
  
p

```

<<<<<<< HEAD
#### Drug Counts by Year

From this output we can see the change from 2012-2018 of each drug and its number of incidents. We see that Fentanyl had a large increase from 2015 to 2018. It also appears that hydrocodone started to decline in the latter years. 


```{r visData2, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
=======
This line plot displays No. of Incidents by Each Drug from 2012-2018. We can see couple of drugs are same over the years but most of them have increased. Specially there is a spike in increase for Fentanyl. Heroine has increased from 2012 to 2016 but it declined steadily in 2017 and 2018.

```{r visData3, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
>>>>>>> 3d1dd3985d4bc8ee495b4e04e385baa0c2a4ac87

#Plot Different Drug Vs Overdose Count for each Year
#Take Year and the different drugs
drugYearCount<- drugOverDoseTD[, c(43, 21:36)]
#Make it a long Tidy Data Set
drugYearCount<- drugYearCount %>% gather(key = Drug, value = 'Y/N', 2:17)
#Remove NAs
drugYearCount<- drugYearCount[complete.cases(drugYearCount) , ]
#make tibble
drugYearCount <- tbl_df(as.data.frame(drugYearCount %>% group_by(Year, Drug) %>% summarise(Count = n())))

#Verify the data
datatable(drugYearCount, options = list(dom ="t"), caption = "Year and Drug", rownames = FALSE)

g<- ggplot(data = drugYearCount, aes(x = Year, y = Count))
g + geom_line(aes(color = Drug, alpha = 0.5), lwd =1.5) + labs(title = "No. of Incidents by Each Drug from 2012-2018 ")

```

<<<<<<< HEAD
#### Drug Counts by Sex

From this data, in the bar plot we can see that the number of male incidents is substantially higher than the number of female incidents. In the line graph, we can see a large increase in the number of male incidents and a smaller increase in the number of female incidents.

```{r visData3, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
=======
This barplot shows the distribution of ages combining all years. 

```{r visData4, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
>>>>>>> 3d1dd3985d4bc8ee495b4e04e385baa0c2a4ac87
#Plot Year with Age and Sex
g<- ggplot(data = drugOverDoseTD %>% select(Age, Sex) %>% drop_na() %>% filter(Sex != 'Unknown'), aes(x = Age, fill = Sex))
g + geom_bar() 

```

This line plot displays the no of incidents over the year for both sex Male and Female. For female the incidents has a steady rise from 2012 to 2017 and a slight decrease in 2018. For male it also has a steady rise from 2012 to 2014 but has a sharp rise from 2014 to 2017 and stabilizes in 2018.

```{r visData5, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}

# Year and Sex Line plot
drugYearSexCount <- as.data.frame(drugOverDoseTD %>% group_by(Year, Sex) %>% summarise(Count = n()))
drugYearSexCount<- drugYearSexCount[complete.cases(drugYearSexCount) & trim(drugYearSexCount$Sex) != 'Unknown', ]

g<- ggplot(data = drugYearSexCount, aes(x = Year, y = Count))
g + geom_line(aes(color = Sex), lwd =1.5)
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
#### Change in Opiod Related Deaths

Our last graph demonstrates that there has been a climb in the number of opiod related deaths from 2015 to 2018. 

```{r visData4, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
=======
The dataset also captures whether the drug responsible is opioid or not and we don't have this data before 2015. The line plot clearly shows we have a steep and steady rise from 2015 to 2016 and 2016 to 2016 respectively.

```{r visData6, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}
>>>>>>> 3d1dd3985d4bc8ee495b4e04e385baa0c2a4ac87
drugOpioid <- drugOverDoseTD %>% group_by(Year, AnyOpioid) %>% summarise(OpioidRelatedDeath = n()) %>% drop_na()

g<- ggplot(data = drugOpioid, aes(x = Year, y = OpioidRelatedDeath))
g + geom_line(aes(color = AnyOpioid), lwd =1.5) + labs(title = "Opioid Related Death from 2015-2018 ")
```
